# Retro Guest Book
Website guest book like in the 90s.

## Database
All comments are stored in a text file. No fancy databases.

## Escaping and security
Should be bare minimal, prevent XSS.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by this video:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSBYO1BYrDM">![youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZSBYO1BYrDM/hqdefault.jpg)</a>

This videos try'd to user the legacy code from the 90s in 2023. This is crazy... But it should be fun to burn a new guest book experience with the experience of today.

## Language
Hold the horses, I said modern, still, lets build this retro project using php.
